# Manual Testing Project (Guru99 Banking WebSite)
Guru99 is a group providing free tutorials at their site: www.guru99.com with a wide range of topics in IT such as Software Development,
Software Testing. etc. The site also provides Live Projects; one of which is a project in Manual Testing featuring a simple
Banking Website containing core banking functionalities. In order to showcase my skills in Manual Functional Testing, I signed up for the
project.

## Contents
The repository contains the following folders:

* **Software Requirements Specifications** - contains the Software Requirements Specifications for the banking website where Test Cases
created are based. The documentations were created based on the format used on my time as a Business Analyst with some revisions following
Agile Methodologies.
* **Master Test Plan** - contains the Test Plan for the project. The format follows the [IEEE-829 Master Test Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_plan) Documentation.
* **Test Cases** - contains all of the created Test Cases based on the Software Requirements Specifications.
* **Defects** - contains all of the defects encountered which were logged using a Issue/Bug Tracking Tool.
* **Test Reports** - contains sample reports generated from a Test Management Tool used for the testing project.

## Tools
The following were the tools used for the project:
* [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/download) - is a powerful tool not only used for Issue/Bug Tracking but also in managing projects as well.
The tool was used for creating Story Tickets for each requirements defined at the Software Requirements Specification document and for logging Bug Tickets for
issues encountered during testing. Defects from the **Defect** folder were extracted from the Jira Software.
* [TestLink](https://sourceforge.net/projects/testlink/) - this is an open source Test Management Tool. The tool was used for creating Test
Projects, Plans, Cases and Steps; logging Test Execution results and generating Test Reports. Test cases from the **Test Case** folder and reports
from the **Test Reports** folder were extracted from TestLink and revised for a consistent documentation format.
